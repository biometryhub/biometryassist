\arguments{
\item{design.obj}{An \code{agricolae} design object.}

\item{nrows}{The number of rows in the design.}

\item{ncols}{The number of columns in the design.}

\item{brows}{For RCBD only. The number of rows in a block.}

\item{bcols}{For RCBD only. The number of columns in a block.}

\item{byrow}{For split-plot only. Logical (default: \code{TRUE}). Provides a way to arrange plots within whole-plots when there are multiple possible arrangements.}

\item{fac.names}{Allows renaming of the \code{A} level of factorial designs (i.e. those using \code{\link[agricolae:design.ab]{agricolae::design.ab()}}) by passing (optionally named) vectors of new labels to be applied to the factors within a list. See examples and details for more information.}

\item{fac.sep}{The separator used by \code{fac.names}. Used to combine factorial design levels. If a vector of 2 levels is supplied, the first separates factor levels and label, and the second separates the different factors.}

\item{plot}{Logical (default \code{TRUE}). If \code{TRUE}, display a plot of the generated design. A plot can always be produced later using \code{\link[=autoplot]{autoplot()}}.}

\item{rotation}{Rotate the text output as Treatments within the plot. Allows for easier reading of long treatment labels. Takes positive and negative values being number of degrees of rotation from horizontal.}

\item{size}{Increase or decrease the text size within the plot for treatment labels. Numeric with default value of 4.}

\item{margin}{Logical (default FALSE). Setting to \code{TRUE} will add a margin (white space) between plot and axes.}

\item{save}{One of \code{FALSE} (default)/\code{"none"}, \code{TRUE}/\code{"both"}, \code{"plot"} or \code{"workbook"}. Specifies which output to save.}

\item{savename}{A filename for the design to be saved to. Default is the type of the design combined with "_design".}

\item{plottype}{The type of file to save the plot as. Usually one of \code{"pdf"}, \code{"png"}, or \code{"jpg"}. See \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave()}} for all possible options.}

\item{return.seed}{Logical (default TRUE). Output the seed used in the design?}

\item{quiet}{Logical (default FALSE). Return the objects without printing output.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave()}} for saving the plot.}
}
\value{
A list containing a data frame with the complete design, a ggplot object with plot layout, the seed (if \code{return.seed = TRUE}), and the \code{satab} object, allowing repeat output of the \code{satab} table via \code{cat(output$satab)}.
}
\description{
Produce a graph of design layout, skeletal ANOVA table and data frame with complete design
}
\details{
If \code{save = TRUE} (or \code{"both"}), both the plot and the workbook will be saved to the current working directory, with filename given by \code{savename}. If one of either \code{"plot"} or \code{"workbook"} is specified, only that output is saved. If \code{save = FALSE} (the default, or equivalently \code{"none"}), nothing will be output.

\code{fac.names} can be supplied to provide more intuitive names for factors and their levels in factorial designs. They should be specified in a list format, for example \code{fac.names = list(A_names = c("a", "b", "c"), B_names = c("x", "y", "z"))}. This will result a design output with a column named \code{A_names} with levels \verb{a, b, c} and another named \code{B_names} with levels \verb{x, y, z}. Only the first two elements of the list will be used.

If \code{fac.sep} is a single element (e.g. "\emph{"), this is used to separate all factor labels (e.g. A_1_B_1). If it is two elements (e.g. c("", "}")), the first element separates the factor names and their levels, and the second level separates the two factors (e.g. A1_B1).

\code{...} allows extra arguments to be passed to ggsave for output of the plot. The details of possible arguments can be found in  \code{\link[ggplot2:ggsave]{ggplot2::ggsave()}}.
