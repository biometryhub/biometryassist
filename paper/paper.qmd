# Summary

A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.

Researchers and biometricians working in agriculture often face challenges in generating, randomising, and analysing field experiments with complex layouts. Designing agricultural experiments that are both statistically valid and practical in the field is a complex task, and analysing those experiments can be even more challenging. The goal of `biometryassist` is to 

The `biometryassist` package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/biometryhub/biometryassist). All instructions for installation and usage can be found in the [package documentation website](https://biometryhub.github.io/biometryassist).
