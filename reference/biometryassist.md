# biometryassist: Functions to Assist Design and Analysis of Agronomic Experiments

Provides functions to aid in the design and analysis of agronomic and
agricultural experiments through easy access to documentation and helper
functions, especially for users who are learning these concepts. While
not required for most functionality, this package enhances the
\`asreml\` package which provides a computationally efficient algorithm
for fitting mixed models using Residual Maximum Likelihood. It is a
commercial package that can be purchased as 'asreml-R' from 'VSNi'
<https://vsni.co.uk/>, who will supply a zip file for local
installation/updating (see <https://asreml.kb.vsni.co.uk/>).
